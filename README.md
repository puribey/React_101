# React 101

> Self learning experience. Inside this repository you'll find everything I'll use to get started with ReactJS. Wish me luck!

## Branch: One

**Install globally all this Packages:**

* npm install -g webpack
* npm install -g standard
* npm install -g mocha
* npm install -g nodemon

React uses either JSX or ES6 which means than in order to work with this we need Babel to translate either of these into Vanilla js.

1. Run npm init in the console
2. Install the following packages:
* npm install react react-dom --save
* npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --save-dev
* npm install webpack webpack-dev-server --save-dev
3. Create webpack.config.js

Things to look for:
- Regular expresions


JSX notes:
Allows you to write HTML in js

ES6 notes:

``` 
doing this:

function () {
	return ()
}

is the same as doing this: 

() => ()

```
